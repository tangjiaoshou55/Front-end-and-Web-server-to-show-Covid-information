# Front-end-and-Web-server-to-show-Covid-information
This Web can show the most recent covid info that pull from the CDC. I turn all these data into the charts.

Use Python with JavaScript to build the Front-end and Web server. 

## In this Project, I achieve these functions:

Filtering and cleaning data

Reading data from and writing data to a file 

Working with backend data

Write a simple web server, code the front-end JavaScript including visualizations, and assemble project components into a web application
